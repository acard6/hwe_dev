plan on making an 3d n x n x n LED matrix from apa106 LED. using this as a base to theorize whatfunctions to implement on it once cube can handle it.

Things to note:
    I plan to start with a samller n x n test out LED(ordered 50 so like 7x7). From there expand to play around with a 3d concept(with the same 50 try 3x3x3 or 4x4x4 but leave the last 14 out for now). After that move onto using 4 or 5 32x32 LED panels and make 3d graphics with that
